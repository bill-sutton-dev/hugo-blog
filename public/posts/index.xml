      <description>Introduction I have never really been able to really make use blogs in an effective manner in the past. I am hoping that I can use this github site as a way to do a little more and try to expand on projects I have been wanting to do in the past but never found the time.&#xA;I do have a bit of a vacation coming up but hope to be able to expand after and use this for personal thoughts and projects.</description>
