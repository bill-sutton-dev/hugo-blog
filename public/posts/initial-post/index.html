<p>I have never really been able to really make use blogs in an effective manner in the past. I am hoping that I can use this github site as a way to do a little more and try to expand on projects I have been wanting to do in the past but never found the time.</p>
<p>I do have a bit of a vacation coming up but  hope to be able to expand after and use this for personal thoughts and projects. I am really just writting this as a stream of conciousnes at now and it is porbably riddled with errors and issues.</p>
<p>I am also using this post to verify my DNS routing and such.</p>
